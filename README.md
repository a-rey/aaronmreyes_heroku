# Django server with DB backend on Heroku

My personal Django server running on heroku that I use in personal projects as a web backend

## TODO:

#### pixels
- add syntax highlighting for python for a browser text editor? (maybe make a portable version of this?)
- set code editing form to fit the screen height correctly
  - setting height attribute in style of textarea only adjusts to the number of rows given
  - need a way to count the number of lines in the routine to set the rows attribute of the textarea
- figure out how to code a radio button in django for the mainpage form
